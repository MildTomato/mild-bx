Set up Supabase in the current directory.

Creates the `supabase/` folder structure. You can start with local development
(no account needed), connect to an existing project, or create a new one.

Run this once at the root of your repository to get started.

## What it does

1. Asks how you'd like to develop (local, connect existing, or create new)
2. Creates the `supabase/` directory structure
3. If connecting to the platform: configures your workflow profile and fetches project config

## Interactive flow

Running `supa init` starts with a gateway question:

```ansi
$ supa init

  ◆  How would you like to develop?
  │  ● Local development              No account needed, connect to cloud later
  │  ○ Connect to existing project    Link to a project on Supabase Platform
  │  ○ Create a new project           Set up a new project on Supabase Platform
  └
```

### Local development

Choosing "Local development" creates the project structure instantly — no
account or login required:

```ansi
  ✓ Initialized Supabase (local)

  Created in ./supabase/
    config.json
    schema/public/
    migrations/
    functions/
    types/

  Start writing SQL in supabase/schema/
  When you're ready to deploy, run supa init again to connect to the platform.
```

### Connecting to the platform

Choosing "Connect to existing project" or "Create a new project" walks you
through the full setup — organization, project, schema management, workflow
profile, and more.

If you previously ran `supa init` locally, running it again will detect the
existing project and offer to connect it to the platform.

## Created files

After initialization, your project has this structure:

```
your-project/
├── supabase/
│   ├── config.json      # Project configuration
│   ├── schema/          # SQL schema files (synced with remote)
│   ├── migrations/      # Version-controlled migrations
│   └── types/
│       └── database.ts  # Generated TypeScript types
└── .env.local           # API credentials (if new project)
```

## Usage

```bash
supa init [options]
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `-y, --yes` | boolean | Skip prompts and use defaults |
| `--local` | boolean | Initialize locally without connecting to Supabase Platform |
| `--org <SLUG>` | string | Organization slug |
| `--project <REF>` | string | Link to existing project by ref |
| `--name <NAME>` | string | Name for new project (requires --org and --region) |
| `--region <REGION>` | string | Region for new project (e.g., us-east-1) |
| `--json` | boolean | Output as JSON |
| `--dry-run` | boolean | Preview what would be created without making changes |

### `--local`

Skip the interactive prompt and initialize locally without connecting to Supabase Platform. Creates the `supabase/` directory structure with a minimal `config.json` (no `project_id`).

Run `supa init` again later to connect to the platform when you're ready to deploy.

### `--project`

Link to an existing project using its reference ID. Find your project ref in the dashboard URL: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<ref>`

## Examples

### Interactive setup

```bash
supa init
```

### Local development (no account needed)

Get started immediately without a Supabase account. Creates the project structure so you can start writing SQL schema files right away.

```bash
supa init --local
```

### Link to existing project

```bash
supa init --project abc123xyz
```

### Create new project non-interactively

For CI/CD pipelines or scripts where you can't use interactive prompts.

```bash
supa init --org my-org --name my-project --region us-east-1
```
