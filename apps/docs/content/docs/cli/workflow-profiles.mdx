title: Workflow Profiles
description: Choose how you deploy changes to Supabase
---

Workflow profiles define how the CLI handles deployments. Choose a profile that matches your team's development process.

## Available Profiles

| Profile | Best For | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `solo` | Individual developers | Direct deployments to production |
| `staged` | Small teams | Staging environment for testing |
| `preview` | Larger teams | Isolated preview environments |
| `preview-git` | CI/CD workflows | Branch-based preview environments |

## Solo Profile

The simplest workflow — changes go directly to your production project.

```bash
supa project profile --set solo
```

When you run `supa project push`, changes apply immediately to production.

Use this when:
- You're the only developer
- You have a separate test project
- You want fast iteration

## Staged Profile

Adds a staging environment between development and production.

```bash
supa project profile --set staged
```

Workflow:
1. `supa project push` deploys to staging
2. Test your changes in staging
3. Promote to production when ready

Use this when:
- You want to test before production
- Multiple developers share a staging environment

## Preview Profile

Creates isolated preview environments for each feature.

```bash
supa project profile --set preview
```

Each push creates a new preview environment that doesn't affect staging or production.

Use this when:
- You want isolated testing per feature
- Team members need separate environments
- You're reviewing pull requests

## Preview-Git Profile

Automatically creates preview environments based on git branches.

```bash
supa project profile --set preview-git
```

The CLI watches your git branch and automatically:
- Creates a preview environment for each branch
- Syncs changes when files change
- Cleans up when branches are deleted

Use this when:
- You have CI/CD pipelines
- You want automatic preview deployments
- You're using GitHub/GitLab branch workflows

## Checking Your Profile

View your current profile:

```bash
supa project profile
```

Output:

```
Current workflow profile: solo

Profiles:
  solo        - Direct production deployments
  staged      - Staging environment for testing
  preview     - Isolated preview environments
  preview-git - Branch-based preview environments
```

## Changing Profiles

Switch profiles at any time:

```bash
supa project profile --set staged
```

The new profile takes effect immediately for subsequent commands.

## Profile Behavior Summary

| Action | solo | staged | preview | preview-git |
|--------|------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `push` | → Production | → Staging | → Preview | → Branch Preview |
| `pull` | ← Production | ← Staging | ← Preview | ← Branch Preview |
| `dev` | Watches + pushes | Watches + pushes | Watches + pushes | Auto branch switching |
